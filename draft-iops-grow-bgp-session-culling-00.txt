 Mitigating Negative Impact of Maintenance through BGP Session Culling
                 draft-iops-grow-bgp-session-culling-00

Abstract

   This document outlines an approach to mitigate negative impact on
   networks resulting from maintenance activities.  It includes guidance
   for both Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and IP networks.  The
   approach is to ensure BGP-4 sessions affected by the maintenance are
   forcefully torn down before the actual maintenance activities
   commence.

1.  Introduction

   In network topologies where BGP speaking routers are directly
   attached to each other, or use fault detection mechanisms such as BFD
   [RFC5880], detecting and acting upon a link down event (for example
   when someone yanks the physical connector) in a timely fashion is
   straightforward.

   However, in topologies where upper layer fast fault detection
   mechanisms are unavailable and the lower layer topology is hidden
   from the BGP speakers, operators rely on BGP Hold Timer Expiration
   (section 6.5 of [RFC4271]) to initiate traffic rerouting.  Common BGP
   Hold Timer values are anywhere between 90 and 180 seconds, which
   implies there window of 90 to 180 seconds in which traffic
   blackholing can occur if the lower layer network is not able to
   forward traffic.

   Session Culling is the practise of ensuring BGP sessions are
   forcefully torn down, before maintenance activities on a lower layer
   network commence, which otherwise would affect the flow of data
   between the BGP speakers.

2.  BGP Session Culling

   From the viewpoint of the IP network operator, there are two types of
   BGP Session Culling:

   Voluntary BGP Session Teardown:  The operator initiates the tear down
      of the potentially affected BGP session by issuing an
      Administrative Shutdown.

   Involuntary BGP Session Teardown:  The operator of the lower layer
      network disrupts BGP control-plane traffic in the upper layer,
      causing the BGP Hold Timers of the affected BGP session to expire,
      subsequently triggering rerouting of end user traffic.

2.1.  Voluntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations

   Before an operator commences activities which can cause disruption to
   the flow of data through the lower layer network, an operator would
   do well to Administratively Shutdown the BGP sessions running across
   the lower layer network and wait a few minutes for data-plane traffic
   to subside.

   While architectures exist to facilitate quick network reconvergence
   (such as BGP PIC [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic]), an operator cannot assume
   the remote side has such capabilities.  As such, a grace period
   between the Administrative Shutdown and the impacting maintenance
   activities is warranted.

   After the maintenance activities have concluded, the operator is
   expected to restore the BGP sessions to their original Administrative
   state.

2.2.  Involuntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations

   In the case where multilateral interconnection between BGP speakers
   is facilitated through a switched layer-2 fabric, such as commonly
   seen at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), different operational
   considerations can apply.

   In the absence of notifications from the lower layer (e.g. ethernet
   link down) consistent with the planned maintenance activities in a
   densely meshed multi-node layer-2 fabric, the caretaker of the fabric

   could opt to cull BGP sessions on behalf of the stakeholders
   connected to the fabric.

   Such culling of control-plane traffic will pre-empt the loss of end-
   user traffic, by causing the expiration of BGP Hold Timers ahead of
   the moment where the expiration would occur without intervention from
   the fabric's caretaker.

   In this scenario, BGP Session Culling is accomplished through the
   application of a combined layer-3 and layer-4 packet filter deployed
   in the switched fabric itself.

2.3.  Involuntary BGP Session Teardown Considerations

   The packet filter should be designed and specified in a way that:

   o  only affect link-local BGP traffic i.e. forming part of the
      control plane of the system described, rather than multihop BGP
      which merely transits

   o  only affect BGP, i.e. TCP/179

   o  make provision for the bidirectional nature of BGP, i.e. that
      sessions may be established in either direction

   o  affect all relevent AFIs

   Appendix A contains an example of such a packet filter.

2.4.  Monitoring Considerations

   XXXX can monitor dataplane traffic and carry out the maintenance
   without impact to traffic once session culling is complete

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
