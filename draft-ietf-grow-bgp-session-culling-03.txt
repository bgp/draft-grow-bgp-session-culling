 Mitigating Negative Impact of Maintenance through BGP Session Culling
                 draft-ietf-grow-bgp-session-culling-03

Abstract

   This document outlines an approach to mitigate negative impact on
   networks resulting from maintenance activities.  It includes guidance
   for both IP networks and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).  The
   approach is to ensure BGP-4 sessions affected by the maintenance are
   forcefully torn down before the actual maintenance activities
   commence.

1.  Introduction

   BGP Session Culling is the practice of ensuring BGP sessions are
   forcefully torn down before maintenance activities on a lower layer
   network commence, which otherwise would affect the flow of data
   between the BGP speakers.

   BGP Session Culling ensures that lower layer network maintenance
   activities cause the minimum possible amount of disruption, by
   causing BGP speakers to preemptively converge onto alternative paths
   while the lower layer network's forwarding plane remains fully
   operational.

   The grace period required for a successful application of BGP Session
   Culling is the sum of the time needed to detect the loss of the BGP
   session, plus the time required for the BGP speaker to converge onto
   alternative paths.  The first value is often governed by the BGP Hold
   Timer (section 6.5 of [RFC4271]), commonly between 90 and 180

   seconds.  The second value is implementation specific, but could be
   as much as 15 minutes when a router with a slow control-plane is
   receiving a full set of Internet routes.

   Throughout this document the "Caretaker" is defined to be the
   operator of the lower layer network, while "Operators" directly
   administrate the BGP speakers.  Operators and Caretakers implementing
   BGP Session Culling are encouraged to avoid using a fixed grace
   period, but instead monitor forwarding plane activity while the
   culling is taking place and consider it complete once traffic levels
   have dropped to a minimum (Section 3.3).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  BGP Session Culling

   From the viewpoint of the IP network operator, there are two types of
   BGP Session Culling:

   Voluntary BGP Session Teardown:  The Operator initiates the tear down
      of the potentially affected BGP session by issuing an
      Administrative Shutdown.

   Involuntary BGP Session Teardown:  The Caretaker of the lower layer
      network disrupts BGP control-plane traffic in the upper layer,
      causing the BGP Hold Timers of the affected BGP session to expire,
      subsequently triggering rerouting of end user traffic.

3.1.  Voluntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations

   Before an Operator commences activities which can cause disruption to
   the flow of data through the lower layer network, an operator can
   reduce loss of traffic by issuing an administrative shutdown to all
   BGP sessions running across the lower layer network and wait a few
   minutes for data-plane traffic to subside.

   While architectures exist to facilitate quick network reconvergence
   (such as BGP PIC [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic]), an operator cannot assume
   the remote side has such capabilities.  As such, a grace period
   between the Administrative Shutdown and the impacting maintenance
   activities is warranted.

Internet-Draft             BGP Session Culling               August 2017


   After the maintenance activities have concluded, the operator is
   expected to restore the BGP sessions to their original Administrative
   state.

3.1.1.  Maintenance Considerations

   Initiators of the administrative shutdown could consider using
   Graceful Shutdown [I-D.ietf-grow-bgp-gshut] to facilitate smooth
   drainage of traffic prior to session tear down, and the Shutdown
   Communication [I-D.ietf-idr-shutdown] to inform the remote side on
   the nature and duration of the maintenance activities.

3.2.  Involuntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations

   In the case where multilateral interconnection between BGP speakers
   is facilitated through a switched layer-2 fabric, such as commonly
   seen at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), different operational
   considerations can apply.

   Operational experience shows many network operators are unable to
   carry out the Voluntary BGP Session Teardown recommendations, because
   of the operational cost and risk of co-ordinating the two
   configuration changes required.  This has an adverse affect on
   Internet performance.

   In the absence notifications from the lower layer (e.g. ethernet link
   down) consistent with the planned maintenance activities in a
   switched layer-2 fabric, the Caretaker of the fabric could choose to
   cull BGP sessions on behalf of the Operators connected to the fabric.

   Such culling of control-plane traffic will pre-empt the loss of end-
   user traffic, by causing the expiration of BGP Hold Timers ahead of
   the moment where the expiration would occur without intervention from
   the fabric's Caretaker.

   In this scenario, BGP Session Culling is accomplished through the
   application of a combined layer-3 and layer-4 packet filter deployed
   in the switched fabric itself.

3.2.1.  Packet Filter Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the packet filter design:

   o  The packet filter MUST only affect BGP traffic specific to the
      layer-2 fabric, i.e. forming part of the control plane of the
      system described, rather than multihop BGP traffic which merely
      transits

Internet-Draft             BGP Session Culling               August 2017


   o  The packet filter MUST only affect BGP, i.e. TCP/179

   o  The packet filter SHOULD make provision for the bidirectional
      nature of BGP, i.e. that sessions may be established in either
      direction

   o  The packet filter MUST affect all relevant Address Family
      Identifiers.

   Appendix A contains examples of correct packet filters for various
   platforms.

3.2.2.  Hardware Considerations

   Not all hardware is capable of deploying Layer 3 / Layer 4 filters on
   Layer 2 ports, and even on platforms which claim support for such a
   feature, limitations may exist or hardware resource allocation
   failures may occur during filter deployment which may cause
   unexpected results.  These problems may include:

   o  Platform inability to apply layer 3/4 filters on ports which
      already have layer 2 filters applied

   o  Layer 3/4 filters supported for IPv4 but not for IPv6

   o  Layer 3/4 filters supported on physical ports, but not on 802.3ad
      Link Aggregate ports

   o  Failure of the operator to apply filters to all 802.3ad Link
      Aggregate ports

   o  Limitations in ACL hardware mechanisms causing filters not to be
      applied

   o  Fragmentation of ACL lookup memory causing transient ACL
      application problems which are resolved after ACL removal /
      reapplication

   o  Temporary service loss during hardware programming

   o  Reduction in hardware ACL capacity if the platform enables
      lossless ACL application

   It is advisable for the operator to be aware of the limitations of
   their hardware, and to thoroughly test all complicated configurations
   in advance to ensure that problems don't occur during production
   deployments.

3.3.  Procedural Considerations

   The Caretaker of the lower layer network can monitor data-plane
   traffic (e.g. interface counters) and carry out the maintenance
   without impact to traffic once session culling is complete.

   It is recommended that the packet filters are only deployed for the
   duration of the maintenance and immediately removed after the
   maintenance.  To prevent unnecessarily troubleshooting, it is
   RECOMMENDED that Caretakers notify the affected operators before the
   maintenance takes place, and make it explicit that the Involuntary
   BGP Session Culling methodology will be applied.
